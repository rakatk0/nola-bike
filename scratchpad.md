***Do you know what you want to be when you grow up? I.e., how do you see this final project fitting with your current job/career track? Or are you looking for a career change? Please explain.***

This project could link back to my undergraduate degree (BS in landscape architecture), where I worked to create developmental strategies related to community-based decision-making regarding proposed land use planning at the county level...

I could go describe a number of maps and paths to embark upon, but ideally the end goal is that I've got a slick webmap that represents an array of skills that I'll use to find a way to work remotely doing some combo of the hats I've worn for the past 15 years: landscape architect, planner, construction manager, graphic designer, strategic analyst, operations manager, etc. 

***What data and/or mapping skills are you looking to learn or improve upon within this course and the final mapping project process?***

I would like to create webmap that has: 
- rich, immersive data 
- useful/practical applications
- dataset processed on the fly 
- resilient, flexible code
- interest and relevance

***Anything else you'd like to share with your instructor? Concerns, questions, confessions?***
I'm a little terrified...but that's not new for me starting a new class, and I  have some good directions to move in and some flexibility with my schedule.  

FYI I hope its not an issue but I'm on Family Medical Leave from work due to a seizure.  Should have more time to work than in past few courses, but have to work around the health issues that put me on leave.  Keeping up will be key to minimizing stress and achieving positive outcomes.

#### ***Nascent project topic ideas and datasets***
##### A general statement as to your thinking for the final project

I'd like to create a webmap that is: 
- interesting/relevant
- rich/immersive
- useful/practical 
- processed on the fly from "live" data
- coded in a resilient/durable/flexible way


A project concept I've had in mind is a  "What-if" scenario map that provides the user with a robust UI that allows for a tremendous range of user-generated "scenario maps". such as the well-maintained https://nuclearsecrecy.com/nukemap/

A few ideas: 
- ***land-use site-suitability matrix builder*** (community-based planning decision-making tool) where users could toggle on or off different desirable (proximity to park) or undesirable features (atop a sinkhole) to generate heatmaps. Such a map could scrape Openstreet for many features, allowing for a global solution.  
- ***stormwater runoff explorer*** (how would development scenarios impact downstream water quality/quantity) / flood-risk visualizer









##### 2 - 3 general topic ideas posted as bullet points

##### A vague indication of where that data may come from

Final Project Stage 1: From interests to focused topics

    Due Feb 5 by 11:59pm Points 10 Submitting a text entry box or a website url

Coming up with a focused mapping project idea can be challenging. We want many components to align:

    our motivated interests,
    the availability of the data,
    the feasibility of the technologies (and our skills) to support designing a mapping solution,
    some broader significance for an audience of map users.

Having the freedom to make whatever map you like can be daunting. Constraints can be good and offer direction. How do we move from interests to broad topics to focused topics?

Drawing from The Craft of Research by Booth, et. al., (2003) and included within your course files:

Step 1: Name your topic.

Begin with your interests to identify some broad topics. These can be stated in general terms: renewable energy, sustainable food systems, migration. But in these general terms, they're not useful for starting a mapping project. We need to make them more concrete and focus them. Try completing the following sentence:

I want to design a map that (investigates, explores, reveals) ________.

Step 2: Add a question.

Including an indirect question can help specify what it is you intend to do with the mapping process of moving from exploring unknowns to revealing knows. It helps establish why you are making this map.

I want to design a map that X

because I want to find out who/what/when/where/whether/why/how _________.

For example:

I am mapping renewable energy because I want to find out whether wind and solar can meet our growing power needs, or

I am mapping renewable energy because I want to know where to ideally site wind turbine farms.

Step 3: Motivate the question.

This third step helps to further focus the project because it moves the purpose from your own interests to the map user or broader audience. It helps establish the significance of the map.

I want to design a map that X

because I want to find out who/what/when/where/whether/why/how _________,

in order to help the map user or audience understand better ____________.

This third step can be challenging at this point in the process, so don't get discouraged if you have a hard time answering it. But it's good to begin thinking about and approaches the user-centered design approaches we explored in Modules 05 and 06 of MAP673.
Assignment

Please complete the following and submit the URL by midnight on Wednesday, February 5th:

    Create a GitHub repository for your mapping project on your personal GitHub account. Give the repo a name. A general name is fine for now; remember we can rename the repository later to make it more specific for your topic. You can make the repo public or private, your choice.
    Add your instructor (@rgdonohue) as a collaborator with write permissions.
    Use Markdown within the README.md to capture a summary of your data topic or potential topics. Use your post from the Canvas Discussion Nascent project topic ideas and datasets as a point of departure.
        For the topic (or each topic), try to capture the essence by completing the formula established above:
            Topic: want to design a map that  _____
            Question: because I want to find out what/why/how _______, 
            Significance: in order to help the user understand ________.
    Include links to potential or relevant datasets in the README.md file.
    Optional: include a data/ directory in the repo and push up datasets. Caution: remember to not commit data files larger than 100MB to Git and attempt to push to GitHub. See Git Large File Storage instead: https://git-lfs.github.com/ 
  ```  
Topic: want to design a map that  __________,
Question: because I want to find out what/why/how _______, 
Significance: in order to help the user _________.


----------------






As a team, the class assisted with identifying planning opportunities and constraints, and lead a community-planning process that prioritized stakeholder feedback, which was gathered through the use of a digital voting system.  

Using community-feedback, a series of land-use scenarios were presented, representing a variety of priorities.  Some were had significant protections for local environmental.  

The data acquired from these discussions lead to the development of a land use master plan for the community.   






Users can explore the datasets and determine their own matrix

starts with a questionnaire/survey? 

```



Toggle importance
toggle buffer ranges

edges
features    
places
spots



Users can add point/line/polygon? 

Users can "submit" their datasets to a "collective" map that adds all users together


McHargian Dataset Layering @ hexbin granule 

Map Algebra
Raster Calculation





How "local" is this solution? global datasets may be poor resolution, or incomplete/untrustworthy?

communicates environmental geographies as layered networks
communicates opportunities 
communicates constraints

answer a real question - not just a prototype






survey - 
what do you value? 

water quality
existing tree canopy 
connectivity
greenspace
rural character

map

What layers (datasets) are important to the user, and why?   

not a "heatmap", but an interactive, visually-encoded suitability matrix

UI features:
rollover with all values calculating hex value


Datasets: 
environmental
- waterways/floodplains
- 
physical
cultural
