Final Project Stage 1: From interests to focused topics

    Due Feb 5 by 11:59pm Points 10 Submitting a text entry box or a website url

Coming up with a focused mapping project idea can be challenging. We want many components to align:

    our motivated interests,
    the availability of the data,
    the feasibility of the technologies (and our skills) to support designing a mapping solution,
    some broader significance for an audience of map users.

Having the freedom to make whatever map you like can be daunting. Constraints can be good and offer direction. How do we move from interests to broad topics to focused topics?

Drawing from The Craft of Research by Booth, et. al., (2003) and included within your course files:

Step 1: Name your topic.

Begin with your interests to identify some broad topics. These can be stated in general terms: renewable energy, sustainable food systems, migration. But in these general terms, they're not useful for starting a mapping project. We need to make them more concrete and focus them. Try completing the following sentence:

I want to design a map that (investigates, explores, reveals) ________.

Step 2: Add a question.

Including an indirect question can help specify what it is you intend to do with the mapping process of moving from exploring unknowns to revealing knows. It helps establish why you are making this map.

I want to design a map that X

because I want to find out who/what/when/where/whether/why/how _________.

For example:

I am mapping renewable energy because I want to find out whether wind and solar can meet our growing power needs, or

I am mapping renewable energy because I want to know where to ideally site wind turbine farms.

Step 3: Motivate the question.

This third step helps to further focus the project because it moves the purpose from your own interests to the map user or broader audience. It helps establish the significance of the map.

I want to design a map that X

because I want to find out who/what/when/where/whether/why/how _________,

in order to help the map user or audience understand better ____________.

This third step can be challenging at this point in the process, so don't get discouraged if you have a hard time answering it. But it's good to begin thinking about and approaches the user-centered design approaches we explored in Modules 05 and 06 of MAP673.
Assignment

Please complete the following and submit the URL by midnight on Wednesday, February 5th:

    Create a GitHub repository for your mapping project on your personal GitHub account. Give the repo a name. A general name is fine for now; remember we can rename the repository later to make it more specific for your topic. You can make the repo public or private, your choice.
    Add your instructor (@rgdonohue) as a collaborator with write permissions.
    Use Markdown within the README.md to capture a summary of your data topic or potential topics. Use your post from the Canvas Discussion Nascent project topic ideas and datasets as a point of departure.
        For the topic (or each topic), try to capture the essence by completing the formula established above:
            Topic: want to design a map that  _____
            Question: because I want to find out what/why/how _______, 
            Significance: in order to help the user understand ________.
    Include links to potential or relevant datasets in the README.md file.
    Optional: include a data/ directory in the repo and push up datasets. Caution: remember to not commit data files larger than 100MB to Git and attempt to push to GitHub. See Git Large File Storage instead: https://git-lfs.github.com/
    ```
