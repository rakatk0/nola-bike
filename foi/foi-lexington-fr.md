Dear [custodian of records]:


Under the Kentucky Open Records Act § 61.872 et seq., I am requesting an opportunity to inspect or obtain copies of public records that [Describe the records or information sought with enough detail for the public agency to respond.  Be as specific as your knowledge of the available records will allow. But it is more important to describe the information you are seeking.]

<!-- spin bike data -->



<!-- contracts with hardware and software vendors/contractors/consultants
whose database are you using? 
internal policy on how these systems are to be utilized/deployed
database of camera locations and technical specifications of cameras used
total number of faces recognized, to date
total number of arrests based on investigations using facial recognition data -->



If there are any fees for searching or copying these records, please inform me if the cost will exceed $100.  However, I would also like to request a waiver of all fees in that the disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest and will contribute significantly to the public’s understanding of how facial recognition systems are being used by authorities in Lexington, Kentucky.  This information is not being sought for commercial purposes.
 
The Kentucky Open Records Act requires a response time within three business days.  If access to the records I am requesting will take longer than that time period, please contact me with information about when I might expect copies or the ability to inspect the requested records.

If you deny any or all of this request, please cite each specific exemption you feel justifies the refusal to release the information and notify me of the appeal procedures available to me under the law.

Thank you for considering my request.


Sincerely,


[Your Name]
